## üîê Key Features

- Privacy-preserving spam classification using encrypted vectors and weights  
- Seamless integration of preprocessing, vectorization, encryption, and prediction  
- Designed for secure environments where data confidentiality is critical  
- Client-side secret key management with no server-side exposure  
- Supports encrypted inference with logistic regression over FHE

## üîÑ Flow: How SpamGuard AI Works

1. **Client-side preprocessing**  
   The user‚Äôs input email text is preprocessed and converted into a numerical feature vector.

2. **Client-side encryption**  
   The input vector and model parameters (weights and intercept) are encrypted using the piheaan library.  
   ‚û§ The **secret key is kept solely on the client side**, and the server has no access to it.

3. **Encrypted data transmission**  
   The encrypted input text(vector) and model parameters are Base64-encoded and transmitted to the server.

4. **Server-side encrypted prediction**  
   The server performs logistic regression prediction directly on the encrypted data.  
   ‚û§ The server never accesses any plaintext data during this computation.(NO secret key)

5. **Encrypted result transmission**  
   The encrypted prediction result (a score) is returned to the client in Base64-encoded form.

6. **Client-side decryption & classification**  
   The client decodes and decrypts the score using the secret key and classifies the result as **spam** or **not spam**.

   > üí° **Why not use the sigmoid function?**  
   > This model performs binary classification, where the classification decision depends only on whether the probability is above or below 0.5.  
   > Therefore, it's not necessary to explicitly compute the probability using the sigmoid function ‚Äî we can directly use the raw linear output `z` (before applying sigmoid) to make the decision.  
   >  
   > In a homomorphic encryption (HE) setting, approximating the sigmoid function is computationally expensive and introduces loss of precision due to its non-linearity and division operations.  
   >  
   > ‚öôÔ∏è Instead of applying an expensive sigmoid approximation, we simply interpret the encrypted result based on whether `z > 0` (not spam) or `z ‚â§ 0` (spam).

## üìÅ Technologies Used

- piheaan: HE library for homomorphic operations
- Logistic Regression: Machine learning model for binary classification
- React + TypeScript: Client-side application
- Python (FastAPI): Server-side server for prediction / Client-side server for encryption & decryption

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note

All computations on the server are done on encrypted data. The secret key **never leaves the client**, making this system suitable for environments where data privacy and zero-trust architectures are required.
